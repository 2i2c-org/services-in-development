# services in development

**This is a repository to track in-progress service design work, it is not documentation for our services.**

**Hypothesis: By communicating with the 2i2c team using this [services](https://github.com/2i2c-org/services) repository there will increased alignment on the current and future state of 2i2 service design work.**

This repository supports service design work in progress (WIP).  

@jmunroe had been using the Google Drive folder [Services](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1WAFsDbgZkNNU6khJ_jGyiAoGk7mJHjH1) as a working space for WIP but it was unclear to the rest of the 2i2c team what is the current, latest, and single source of truth for service design work.  

The intent of this repository is to treat "2i2c Services" as a internal product to track the development and refinement of services.

This repository is public to be consistent with 2i2c's to be open transparent but it does represent work in progress. This distinction is an attempt to avoid confusion with our communities between 'what 2i2c offers' and 'what 2i2c might offer' in terms of our services.

The published version of a 2i2c service will be released using the following sites: 
- [2i2c Team Compass](https://compass.2i2c.org/) As 2i2c's primary source of truth, the operational details and procedures of all services will be published to the Team Compass. Pushing to the Team Compass indicates that a particular version of a service has been released and can be trusted both internally and externally as the official documentation of **how** a service is intended to work. For services, the Team Compass defines how a service is implemented. The intended audience is the 2i2c Team. The Team Compass also needs to explicitly delegate the descriptions of both existing services and potential future services to where that information should be found.
- [2i2c Service Guide](https://docs.2i2c.org/) This is the documentation that 2i2c makes available to its communities and users about what they should expect from our interactive computing platform. As services are integral to the socio-technical platform that are made available to communities, they need to be fully described in the Service Guide. For services, the Service Guide define **what** a service is and what should be expected by communities. The primary intended audience is 2i2c communities and users. The Service Guide should also describe **why** a service is offered and describes intended value to communities. A secondary intended audience is 2i2c sub-teams so there is alignment on available 2i2c services and how to they are intended to be experienced.

A service needs to be consistently described and documented both sites to be considered done. For practically, this [repository](https://github.com/2i2c-org/services) may host the content describing both the how and the what and why for services. The Team Compass and Service Guide can delegate out the content to this repository.

A related externally facing site is the [2i2c Brochure Website](https://2i2c.org) . This is site explains the value proposition of 2i2c's platform and services. For services, the Brochure Website more explicitly ed and demonstrates the intended value to communities and buyers considering joining the 2i2c network.  The intended audience is potential 2i2c communities. This site is the primary responsility of the Business Development. This site and related sales assets should be developed using the descriptions in the Service Guide of *what* and *why* as official sources of information.

## Goals of this repository

1. Clearly answers the question 'What are the 2i2c Services" being developed.
2. Make the processes used in service design more discoverable across the 2i2c team.
3. A versioned storage area for artifacts created during the service design process.
4. Issues to record the historicaly decision making process that led to different service design choices. 

## FAQs

1.  *What is a Service?* Here is a working definition from a service design textbook (Penin, 2018, An Introduction to Service Design)
> "In economic terms, service occurs when there’s a value exchange between parts. One part, the service provider, performs a certain activity that results in some beneﬁt that includes a speciﬁc output and involves certain experiences. The other part, the service user, sees value in the output, the experience, or both combined and is willing to pay for it or exchange for something else of equivalent value."
  
3. *How does this repository different from ProductBoard?* Services are what we are deliverying to 2i2c. A service needs alignment across the entire 2i2c team throughout its entire development life cycle.  ProductBoard remains a useful tool for identifying the drivers for different services and collecting insights about potential services.
